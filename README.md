## Usage

If you're familiar with Laravel validation, you'll find our JavaScript library to be very similar. Our library provides a flexible and easy-to-use API for validating user input in your web applications. [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/validation)

Here's a quick example of how to use our library:

```javascript
import Validation from 'lv-validation';

// Define the validation rules
const rules = {
  name: 'required|string|max:255',
  email: 'required|email|max:255',
  password: 'required|string|min:8',
};

// Validate the input
const input = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  email: 'johndoe@example.com',
  password: 'password123'
};

const validator = Validation.validate(input, rules);

if (validator.passes()) {
  // Continue with your application logic
} else {
  // Display the validation errors to the user
  const errors = validator.errors();
  console.log(errors);
}
```
